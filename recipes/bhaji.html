<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These mini onion bhajis are quick to make and such a treat fresh from the pan. Try them as a snack or alongside a curry. Any extras can be frozen and reheated in the oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
        <li>2 red onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 tbsp chopped fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>½ tsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz gram (chickpea) flour</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>15g/½oz fresh root ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
        <li>salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil to a deep-fat fryer and preheat to 180C. Alternatively, heat around 4–5cm/1½–2in oil in a deep saucepan. To test the oil is hot enough, carefully drop a little of the bhaji batter into the oil – it will sizzle once hot enough and start to brown. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)</li>
        <li>Place the red onion in a large bowl and add the chopped coriander, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander and cumin. Add the gram flour, garlic, ginger and a generous sprinkle of salt. Pour in approximately 75ml/2½fl oz cold water to bind. Mix well again to combine – the mixture should hold together once squeezed but it may be a little sticky. Add a touch more water if the mixture feels too stiff.</li>
        <li>Using wet hands, roll the mixture into 12 small balls that are roughly the size of golf balls.</li>
        <li>Deep-fry the bhajis in the hot oil in two batches for 3–4 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and transfer to kitchen paper to drain. Sprinkle with a little salt and serve warm.</li>
        
    </ol>
